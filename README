Create a calendar of date and time events and execute code based on which
events are currently happening.

Example (print holiday greetings):

require 'seasonal'

holidays = Seasonal::Calendar.new

holidays.push(Seasonal::Event.new(
  'Merry Christmas', 'America/New_York', 'dec 25'))
holidays.push(Seasonal::Event.new(
  "April Fool's Day", 'America/New_York', 'apr 1'))

holidays.going_on { |e| puts e.payload }

Example (make text red between 9:00 and 10:00 am):

require 'seasonal'

colors = Seasonal::Calendar.new

colors.push(Seasonal::Event.new(
  '#ff0000', 'America/New_York', nil, '9:00am', nil, '10:00am'))

color = '#000000'
colors.going_on { |e| color = e.payload }

puts "<p style=\"background-color : #{color}\">test</p>"

Each event has an attached payload which can be any object.

Uses the flexible time parsing of Time.parse to be easy to use and the
timezone and DST handling of tzinfo.
