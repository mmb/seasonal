A way to create date and time events and be yielded the events that are
currently going on in a block.

Each event has an attached payload which can be simply a string or any object.

Uses the flexible time parsing of Time.parse to be easy to use and the
timezone and DST handling of tzinfo.

Originally conceived to be used for changing a web site's color scheme and
messages based on the holidays and seasons.

Inspired by World of Warcraft seasonal events.
